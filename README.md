Advantage-Filtered Behavioral Cloning for Offline Continuous Control

This is the code for my 2021 undergrad thesis at the University of Virginia, "Advantage-Filtered Behavioral Cloning in High Noise Datasets" [[Official Thesis Version]](https://csdmp.github.io/docs/grigsby2021.pdf), [[Conference-Style (Shorter, ArXiv) Edit]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.04698).


If you are interested in this code, please note that I have much more usable versions of this method implemented in my [deep_control](https://github.com/jakegrigsby) and [super_sac](https://github.com/jakegrigsby/super_sac) repositories.
